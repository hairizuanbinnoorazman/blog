## Beginning the use of git

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone {{ remote url }}
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git # e.g.

# Creating a new branch
git checkout -b new_branch

# After making some changes
git add --all
git commit -m "A new temporary feature has been added"
git push -u origin new_branch

# After making even more changes
git add --all
git commit -m "Another new temporary feature has been added"
git push

# After this, do a PR to master branch

# If more changes has been added to master and you need to build off the latest master
git fetch origin master # Fetches it to origin/master branch locally
git diff master origin/master # Checks that the diff is fine, no issues caused
git pull origin master # Does a fetch and merge from origin/master into master

# Cycle repeat
```

## Necessary rebasing efforts

It is often mentioned that rebasing is bad but it is more right to say that rebasing is bad if it affects people who happen to be working on the code. However, in the case of bigger code bases, you don't necessary want to litter your commits with redundant commits. There could be commits that are changes and its reverted changes. Those kind of commits can be "dropped" out. This can be done via the `git rebase` command.

## Useful git commands

List of useful git commands. This is not a full exhaustive list of git commands available. If you're seeking that, you might want to refer to git man pages.

```bash
# Initialize a git repository
# One can create a git repository anymore. You don't necessary need a remote git repository for this
git init

# Cloning a repository from remote url
# Default branch is usually master
# Remote is usually called origin
git clone {{ remote url }}
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Adding changes
git add --all # Try not to use this
git diff {{ file name }} # Check what changes has been done on the file so far
git add {{ file name }}

# Having multiple remotes
# In the case where you want to move repos between groups or mirroring repos between multiple repos
# It is also another way to
git remote -v # This is to view list of remotes available
git remote add {{ new remote ref }} {{ new remote url }}
git remote add tempMirror https://github.com/user1/repo.git

# View list of logs
git log
git log -n 5

# View commit information
git show {{ commit id }}

# Checking out to other branches
git checkout {{ branch_name }}
git checkout {{ commit id }}
git checkout tags/{{ tag name }}

# For safer development, create a new branch and then do pull request to the master fork/branch
# Creates a new branch of from the current branch
# You can then push it to remote accordingly
git checkout -b {{ new branch name}}
git push -u origin {{ new branch name }}
# After doing some changes, you can then do the following as you have already added the remote accordingly
git add --all
git commmit -m "Commit message"
git push

# If you don't want a commit in a git repostory, you can revert the commit
# This would create a new commit that does the reverse of a commit selected
git revert {{ commit id }}

# To view who made the changes to a file etc, you can either dig through each commit one at a time
# OR, you can just use the following command
git blame {{ file name }}
```
