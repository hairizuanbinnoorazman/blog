These are the set of notes for me while watching the Gophercon 2018 at Denver. There is a bunch of live blogs that one can read

- [Go in Debian](#go-in-debian)
- [Extending the Kubernetes API with a Custom Go Operator](#extending-the-kubernetes-api-with-a-custom-go-operator)
- [Immutable Persistent Data Structures in Go](#immutable-persistent-data-structures-in-go)

## Go in Debian

{{< youtube A1QNlu1eiBc >}}

- liveblog by sourgraph: https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/gophercon-2018-go-in-debian
- codesearch.debian.net => Search for code snippets in the debian ecosystem. Maybe for finding code examples or finding code changes between new ones and old code that is to be depreciated
- https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html => Article on code example searches?
- manpages.debian.org => A web archive of all the documentation on debian packages
- debian tool: ratt - a tool to check your package before it hits into the apt repository. https://github.com/Debian/ratt
- debian tool: https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/pk4 => Overlay new packages and test the packages out
- Package for handling debian packages from Go. https://github.com/paultag/go-debian
- Building the debian package. https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/build.en.html
- Making debian package for a golang package. https://github.com/Debian/dh-make-golang
- Some advice:
  - As much as possible, reduce the amount of dependencies as much as possible. `dh-make-golang search pault.ag/go/debian`
  - Use the go tools. Don't introduce/divert away from usual go tooling
  - Test if the package would still work if vendor folder is removed.

## Extending the Kubernetes API with a Custom Go Operator

{{< youtube i_ARHVbp_X4 >}}

- Operators and custom resources. Extended Kubernetes resources, creating like a "MySQL" resource that could generate a 3 cluster MySQL cluster etc.
- operator-sdk
- kubebuilder
- A mentionn about how rbac works in kubernetes:
  - You can apply permissions but you can't exactly edit a set of permissions
  - Need to delete and recreete them
  - rbac manager is supposed to help by deleting and adding it back
- github.com/reactiveops/rbac-manager

## Immutable Persistent Data Structures in Go

{{< youtube wc84syQ5Uxs >}}

- Using immutable types is vital for sanity as well as for concurrency; if an object is mutable, then, we would know the state of it at the point of time when our function is running. If it was mutable, the field may change value which would result in us not being able to deceisively know what is being passed in and what is being used to run the function.

## Lazy JSON Parsing

{{< youtube XsL7ikhjNJw >}}

- Common case where there are json responses with fields that are kind of dependent on other fields. E.g. type etc. And if type changes, a certain portion of the json response could change its fields.
- Usually way to solve it is to use `interface{}`
- However, it would better instead to lazying parse it via json.RawMessage. Save it as bytes that are meant to be parsed later once we get around to using it. Rather than doing all of sorts of error handling to make it safe for use.

## Migrating the go community

{{< youtube LcBB8_kggdY >}}

- Many packages not yet moved to the new module system. Although current v1 compatability is preserved, efforts are still needed to bring everyone over to use the module system
- Tool built to help with upgrading and downgrading of versions: https://github.com/marwan-at-work/mod
- A command is available for use: `mod migrate deps --token=<github token>`. Helps to create fork which would contain the code base to alter the dependent packages to have mod versioning in place
