The following set of summaries are from the Kubecon and Cloud Native Con Europe in Denmark from 2-4 May 2018. 

These summaries are from conference talks that I thought provided more interesting thinking points.

The videos for the conference can be found here:

Below are some of the talks that I found quite interesting (just my own preference)  
I took some of my personal notes so that I don't need to rewatch the videos once more just to get the main point the video seem to talk about.s
