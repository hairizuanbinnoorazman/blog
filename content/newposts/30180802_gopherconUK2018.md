## You might be a Go Contributer Already and Not Know it

{{< youtube id="2mgKDqD5Ga8" >}}

- Go programming language is a project that aims to make programmers more productive
- Skillsets needed to bring a language up (as a community):
  - Community Management
  - Logistics and Event Planning
  - Isolating Reproducible Failures
  - Marketing
  - Teaching and Mentorship
  - Writing, Editing and Publishing technical content
  - Knowledge of how Go is used in companies of different sizes
  - Presentation and Public Speaking
  - Graphical Design
  - Knowledge of Compiler and Architecture
- Contribution to Go is an investment in your own personal development
- Ways to help:
  - Answering questions on Slack, IRL, Stack overflow, mailing list, help forums
  - Opening issues on bugs
  - Sharing experiences, knowledge or perspective on Go (experience reports). Steps involved in writing an expererience report:
    - Describe what you wanted to do
    - Say what you actually did
    - Explain why that wasn't great, using concrete examples from production
  - If you've ever done the following before, why not write on it?
    - Debugged a tough bug in Go
    - Encountered a funny problem in Go program
    - Helped a friend solve an issue in Go
    - Debated Go Code Patterns and Styles with a coworker
  - Organize a local meetup
    - Contact Gobridge, Gophercon and other nearby meetups
    - Co-host events with other developer meetups
    - Host a Go-Bridge event, or help out with one
  - Contributing Go Code
    - Writing libraries outside standard library
    - Open source of utility library?
    - If you happen to have deep domain knowledge to help with some of the core standard library functionality; there are like 600+ packages for these which are part of the Go toolchain to work on
  - Ideas for contributing to Go Project Repositories:
    - Submit examples
    - Augment documentation (if it was confusing, then there's where one should add and alter the documentation at)
    - Look at open issues
    - Try https://dev.golang.org/imfeelinglucky
    - Running on obscure architecture and OSes
  - Four pillars of contributing to Go
    - Helping other Go Programmers solve problems
    - Sharing your experience, knowledge and perspectives on Go
    - Connecting Go programmers together
    - Writing Go Code
