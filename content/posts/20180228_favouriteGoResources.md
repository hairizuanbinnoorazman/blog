This is a personal list of Golang Resources I like to keep track. This is a evergreen list so I will update it once in a while when new stuff pops up.

# Libraries

- Libraries that help in handling web applications/authorization/authentication
  - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
  - [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
  - [Gokit](https://gokit.io/)
  - [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
  - [buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/en)
- [tablewriter](https://github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter)
- [terminal dashboard](https://github.com/gizak/termui)
- [terminal dashboard for processes](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop)

# Tools

- [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
  - Current latest dependency tool that is kind of the official experiment for golang dependency management.
- godoc
  - Part of golang tooling support. When you add documentation above function names - they will pop up within documentation which other developers can possibly consume. 
- Visual Studio Code Golang extension
  - It requires installation of a whole of Golang tool which includes Golang vet etc. Checks to ensure certain heuristics are kept to ensure readable code that is easy to extend.
