Google recently had a Google Cloud conference where they feature all the exciting new technologies that are made available in Google Cloud. There are numerous product announcements that were mentioned in the various keynotes as well as the breakout sessions; so in an attempt to understand what's exactly is happening in terms of major product releases, I did a textual overview of the videos with links to additional resources. This is to highlight some of the brand new google products and how they can be used to serve new business needs and capabilities.

For the full list of videos of all the recorded sessions, refer to the link here:

A playlist would hopefully be released soon.
