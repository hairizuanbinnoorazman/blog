These are some notes that I took while taking my driving license in Singapore at CDC from August 2019 to December 2019. Some of the advice may/may not apply to you when learning to drive - so take all advice with a grain of salt.

## Reminders

List of important things to take note (Read them just before going for TP practical test)

- Signal then blindspot
- Always check blindspot before turning
- S course - full lock before exiting (Prevent wide turning point deducting)
- Reverse parking need delayed turning
- Be calm while switching lanes - don't rush to next lane (Do proper rear view mirror checks and side mirror checks)
- Remember that reference points for reverse parking near crank course is different
- After emergency stop, do checks like moving off (Signal left and check blindspots etc)
- Turn at shoulder only for u turn and going out of reverse parking
- Be more left at zebra crossing (To prevent motorcylist from squeezing on your left)
- At traffic junction, always check pedestrian, then traffic then blindspot
- Drive slower in circuit so that got more time to turn
- Gear 2 for turns (on road)
- In circuit - don't inch out at traffic light... later might get stuck at yellow box
- Accelerator should be on the ball of the feet
- Look out to where you want to go (thru the side mirrors etc)
- Bus stop yellow arrow is a yellow box
- Long filter lane - check 3 times. 1 check before entering filtee lane, 1 check when turning, last check befoee going out
- Turn right from reverse parking with crank course - towards parallel parking - move slightly left then when mirror cross solid white line - full lock right
