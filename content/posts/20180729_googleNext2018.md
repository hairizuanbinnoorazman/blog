Google recently had a Google Cloud conference where they feature all the exciting new technologies that are made available in Google Cloud. There are numerous product announcements that were mentioned in the various keynotes as well as the breakout sessions; so in an attempt to understand what's exactly is happening in terms of major product releases, I did a textual overview of the videos with links to additional resources. This is to highlight some of the brand new google products and how they can be used to serve new business needs and capabilities.

For the full list of videos of all the recorded sessions, refer to the link here:

## Accelerating Your Kubernetes Development with Kubernetes Applications

- Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6koWw0r07Y
- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application
- Steps when running applications
  - Status
    - Installation Progress
    - Resource Activity
  - Connecting
    - Site/Admin URL
    - Service Endpoint
    - Credentials
    - Client Commands
  - Operations
    - User Guide
    - Upgrade
    - Backup/Restore
    - Deletion
- Beforehand, one has to hunt and manage those kubernetes resources to run an "app" manually; e.g. Finding and peeking at the secrets etc. Application resource was kind of introduced to encapsulate and provide some sort of metadata to understand the whole scenario betters
- Helm was an alternative choice, however, the resources are still represented as pods and services and other native Kubernetes resources. Hence, if one needs to debug/operate the whole "application", there is some digging around that needs to be done to get going.
- Resources
  - Pods
  - Persistant Volumes, Persistant Volume Claims
  - Services
  - Deployments, Replica Sets
  - Statefulsets
  - Daemonsets
  - Configmaps, Secrets
  - Ingress

Example of a kubernetes application highlighted in the Google Cloud Console. Look on the portion on the right on how the application section is highlighted to give more context about the application.

## Take Control of your Multi-cluster, Multi-Tenant Kubernetes Workloads

- Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LysDry8xpt4
- Evolution of how kubernetes being used
  - One Cluster per Tenant
  - Multicluster per tenant (Serving multiple regions) + Namespace (Where policy controls etc can be added to control and standardize access)
  - Multitenant and multicluster developement
- GKE Policy Management
  - Centrally defined policies through all clusters - easier to manage
  - Namespaces are the tenants (Granularity to go for)
  - GKE Clusters namespaces are flat based but most organizations are hierarchy in nature
  - Consists of the Policy Importer (Get the policies from various sources, now only on git and Google Cloud GUI), Syncer (Realize changes back on the cluster), Quota Controller (Allow controlling of quota on a group level)
