NOTE: The following is still under construction (Being tested)

This is a quick sample tool to retrieve bus arrivals in Singapore. In order to use it, we would need to find for the Bus Stop ID or Bus Stop Code from where we're taking the bus from. After keying it, it would fetch the records from LTA Datamall's real time bus arrival API and present those records in this tool.
