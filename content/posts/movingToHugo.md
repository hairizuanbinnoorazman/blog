After a long while being on some managed platform for writing blog posts, I decided
to move out of that into one which would require myself to manage things on my own.
A few reasons kind of came up which motivated such a decision:

## Blog posts being Code Centric

Blog post being too code-centric and all those managed platforms somehow managed to 
irritate me when it comes to creating them. 

I've tried a couple, Blogger (I'm guessing it's a Google product but somehow, I'm 
not feeling that polish there), Wordpress and Medium. Wordpress was nice but 
it gets pretty complicated when I wish to add more code centric material; it 
always requires myself to actually go in and adjust it on my own.

## Curiosity on this static file ecosystem

There has been somewhat a quiet rise in the number of static website generator applications
nowadays. Long time ago, Jekyll was a definite winner, its a solution that is always 
mentioned on Github whenever it came to the time to build a site to support the code you're
writing on Github.

However, nowadays, there is a growing number of tools available. One for which is Hugo which is
the one being used to write this blog right here.

Here are some of the others and their links:

- Hugo  
  https://gohugo.io/
- Jekyll (For all time's sake I guess?)  
  https://jekyllrb.com/
- Gatsby JS (Was laughing at that name. Kind of reminded me of a hair product brand which has a bunch of funny ads)  
  https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

## Additional Remarks
